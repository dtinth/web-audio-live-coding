# live-coding-web-audio

I did a live coding session about creating the sound of 8-bit music from scratch
using Web Audio API. This repo contains the code made during the live stream.

**Note that [the code](src/index.js) contains a lot of bad practices and
copy-and-pastes** in order to pull this stuff off in 3 hours. :)

## Recorded session

You can find the recorded session here:

[@MindaRynn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3GAvwaZwf1abbeREza8eA) also
provided her amazing vocals. Much appreciated!

**Demo time:**

* 38:15 — Happy Birthday song in 37 lines of React

* 1:12:40 — Simple keyboard-based synth done. Nandemonaiya.

* 1:58:00 — Simple programmed drum-machine done. Show me your brave heart!

  [ยาพิษ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn7_CFkr6Oo)’s intro drum lick in
  GarageBand.
